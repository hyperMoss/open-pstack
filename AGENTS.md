# open-pstack

This is hyperMoss's personal fork of Arjit Jaiswal's distribution. Keep Arjit's plugin package and provider behavior. Track this fork's durable work in hyperMoss/open-pstack GitHub Issues. Cursor is the content source; other ports are advisory sources of fixes.

Track all durable work in this repository's GitHub Issues. Do not create a parallel Linear queue. Read `UPSTREAM.md` before changing upstream-derived content.

Cursor's `cursor/plugins/pstack` tree is the content upstream. Keep one shared skill tree for Claude Code and Codex; adapt harness primitives at the existing mapping boundaries instead of forking skills or adding compatibility layers. The parent harness freezes the model sheet for a run and owns every provider-routing decision. Children do not detect or reroute themselves.

The default branch `main` is the public installation source and must remain ready for users. Keep unfinished package changes on PR branches. Validate changed behavior before merge, and bump the plugin version when packaged behavior changes, including shared skills and provider instructions. A version string is an update signal, not a barrier that hides unversioned changes from new installs. GitHub release tags document tested checkpoints and provide rollback; they are not an installation prerequisite.

Before opening a pull request, run the Bun tests, strict typecheck, static invariants, and plugin validation.

For changes to Open Pstack, invoke the project-local [verify-open-pstack skill](.agents/skills/verify-open-pstack/SKILL.md) before declaring the work complete, whether or not the user names it or uses poteto-mode. Read its feature map, run the recipes covering the affected behavior, and retain the evidence. Report blocked or unmapped paths as unverified; a CLI check does not replace installed-parent verification. For documentation or maintenance-only changes, use the maintenance evidence requirements below.

Nothing merges, tags, releases, or rolls out until the exact candidate is installed and the changed behavior passes a live test from the real user surface in every affected harness. Unit tests, validators, source inspection, and self-reports do not satisfy this gate. Publish the installed version, surface, action, and observed result through the repository verifier in one evidence comment and a `live-gate` commit status on the exact candidate head. Every new head, including a queue-created head, needs a fresh run. A pull request without applicable evidence remains a draft. The verifier publishes evidence and statuses; it does not queue or merge.

For documentation or maintenance-only changes, prove that the packaged plugin tree is unchanged and exercise the changed CLI or GitHub workflow. There is no affected parent installation in that case. Record the actual maintenance evidence instead of repeating unchanged provider tests; publish the exact-head no-runtime gate only after those checks pass.

Do not add an implicit runtime timeout or a weaker-model fallback. The only permitted substitution is a saved `primary -> fallback` chain in the model sheet on a terminal outcome the sheet's `# fallback` policy authorizes (`usage-exhausted` only when no policy line is saved), per `plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/provider-dispatch.md`; anything else remains a dropout.

## Provider compatibility and major releases

Provider adapters must support compatible patch and minor versions using a documented version range and checks for the capabilities they require. A tested version is evidence, not an exact-version allowlist. Reject a version only for a concrete incompatibility or missing required capability, with an actionable explanation. An exact-version restriction requires a documented incompatibility reason and explicit user approval before implementation. Keep tested versions separate from the supported range, and verify more than one available version when changing provider compatibility.

A major plugin version requires explicit user approval of the version choice before implementation or publication. General authorization to implement, merge, release, or roll out does not authorize a major-version bump.

## Default delivery workflow

For repository changes, carry the work through validation, public PR review, and squash merge without waiting for another user prompt. An explicit request to stop at a draft, review, or unmerged branch overrides this default.

1. Use `create-public-facing-pr` to publish a focused PR with a concise description and verification evidence. Keep unrelated changes in separate PRs.
2. Request Copilot review and use `address-copilot-review` to assess every finding, verify and push appropriate fixes, publish replies, and resolve addressed threads. Confirm replies are submitted rather than pending. If Copilot is unavailable or quota-limited, record that fact; do not treat it as an approval or wait indefinitely.
3. Run the project-local [verify-open-pstack skill](.agents/skills/verify-open-pstack/SKILL.md) against the final candidate. Complete the applicable installed-parent or maintenance checks above and publish the exact-head gate. Revalidate behavior affected by review fixes.
4. Once `verify` and exact-head `live-gate` pass and review threads are resolved, let Mergify squash merge through the one-PR queue. If its update changes the head, rerun verification on that SHA. Workflow changes require an operator queue action. Do not bypass an unavailable queue; leave the PR unmerged and report the blocker. Verify the resulting merge into `main`.
5. When the merge introduces a new plugin version on `main`, publish its matching GitHub tag and release as part of delivery without waiting for another user prompt. Follow [UPSTREAM.md's release procedure](UPSTREAM.md#publish-a-release), tag the verified merge checkpoint whose plugin tree matches the tested candidate, and verify the published tag target and release. Never move an existing tag. If publication is blocked, record the blocker and report the release as pending; merging alone does not complete delivery for a new version. Repository changes that leave the plugin package unchanged need no new version or tag.
6. After merging and completing any required release publication, check linked issues, close those fully resolved by the PR, and verify their closed status on GitHub; report any issue left open to the user with the reason and remaining work.

Proceed autonomously through routine fixes and retries justified by evidence. Existing validation gates and explicit restrictions on credentials, spending, or other actions still apply. When a required check cannot run, document the concrete blocker, complete independent work, and leave the affected PR unmerged. Do not replace a missing live test with a unit-test or source-inspection claim. Tags and releases required by step 5 are within the delivery scope. Other tags, releases, and installation changes outside validation require their own task scope.

## Documentation ownership

Add or keep a public document only when it answers a question readers ask repeatedly. Each maintained fact has one owner. When behavior changes, update the owner in the same change; everywhere else, link rather than restate. Record validation of a particular candidate in its pull request and release notes. Keep reproducible proof in tests and in the verification recipes under `.agents/skills/verify-open-pstack/`. Do not commit lab reports, dated evidence files, or generated proposal artifacts; keep them outside the checkout. To cite past evidence, link a pull request or a commit-pinned GitHub permalink. Never edit an old record to track current state.

`python3 scripts/check-docs.py` checks that the README provider table matches the runner IDs, that relative links and heading anchors resolve, that the public documentation inventory stays within its approved scope, and that the current `CHANGELOG.md` entry and pinned upstream README agree with the package version and Cursor baseline. Passing proves structure, not that all prose is current.
