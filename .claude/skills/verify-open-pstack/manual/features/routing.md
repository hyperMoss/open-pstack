# Routing policy

Users inspect how a saved role resolves, while the parent owns execution and any approved fallback.

## Sub-features

- `routing-resolve`: read the configured lane chains without dispatch.
- `receipt-normalize`: execute the documented command and check accepted and rejected receipts.
- `claude-primary-model`: verify the main Claude assistant model independently of helper usage.
- `codex-completion`: require completed final-turn output while preserving protocol success as a replay veto.
- `devin-refusal-fallback`: exclude inherited provider-side fallback from an assigned Devin lane.
- `receipt-privacy`: bound failure receipts to allowlisted diagnostics and structural counts.
- `opencode-contracts`: verify V1 and V2 native CLI configuration, contract-appropriate completion, and explicit ChatGPT subscription funding through both installed parents.
- `routing-live`: observe the exact approved descriptor and terminal outcome in a parent workflow.
- `routing-recovery`: verify saved fallback transitions with authentic terminal evidence.

## How to get to it (user POV)

Run the shipped `pstack-model-policy resolve` CLI for a named role, or invoke a parent workflow that dispatches that role. Configure assignments through `pstack:setup-pstack`.

## Driving it with the Bun CLI and parent apps

Preconditions: Launch and Doctor passed. Set `VERIFY_MODEL_SHEET` to the approved frozen sheet for this run. Use the parent-supplied copy, or freeze the saved sheet from the location documented in [setup-pstack](../../../../../plugins/pstack/skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md) into the evidence directory. Do not assume the checkout's `AGENTS.md` contains model rows, invent assignments, or rewrite personal configuration. If no approved sheet is available, report the missing fixture. Read `plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/provider-dispatch.md` before any live dispatch.

```bash
: "${VERIFY_MODEL_SHEET:?set the approved frozen model-sheet path}"
capture routing-sheet-before shasum -a 256 "$VERIFY_MODEL_SHEET"
capture routing-resolve "$VERIFY_TOOLS/model-policy/pstack-model-policy" resolve --sheet "$VERIFY_MODEL_SHEET" --role 'how explorer' --parent codex
capture routing-sheet-after shasum -a 256 "$VERIFY_MODEL_SHEET"
capture routing-unchanged diff -u "$VERIFY_EVIDENCE/routing-sheet-before.stdout" "$VERIFY_EVIDENCE/routing-sheet-after.stdout"
```

- **Inspect:** expect exit zero and JSON `status: resolved` with lane descriptors matching the saved `how explorer` row. Inspect authorization and route fields; successful parsing alone does not mean an executable route. `unconfigured` is an unmet precondition for this recipe.
- **Live dispatch:** run the direct How entry in [workflows](workflows.md). Compare actual native launch metadata or external runner receipt with the resolved descriptor, parent, model, effort, access mode, and saved API-spend fact. Retain the final terminal outcome and output.
- **Recovery:** follow the saved fallback-chain scenario in `tests/setup-selected-providers.md`. Require authentic terminal evidence, a visible failure/substitution notice, and any required writer inspection before the exact saved next attempt. A synthetic event passed to the `next` CLI proves a decision only, not a provider failure or parent recovery.

### Documented receipt normalization

For changes to the documented normalization command, run `bun test model-policy/cli.test.ts -t 'documented normalize'` from the installed candidate's `skills/poteto-mode/scripts` directory. The tests extract the executable from `references/provider-dispatch.md`, then check the resulting JSON event and rejection diagnostics using synthetic receipt inputs.

From a fresh installed session in each parent, invoke `pstack:poteto-mode` and ask the parent to use the normalization command in its loaded provider-dispatch reference. Supply a preserved real runner receipt and its matching frozen sheet, role, lane, attempt, parent, and access mode. The `--parent` value must match the receipt's originating parent, even when the test session runs in the other app. Keep that distinction in the evidence. Expect a nonempty JSON event with the matching attempt, terminal status, and receipt path.

Repeat with a copy whose model differs from the frozen assignment. Expect nonzero exit, an identity-mismatch diagnostic, and no policy event. This altered copy is a synthetic negative fixture. Retain both commands, stdout, stderr, exit codes, skill invocation, loaded reference path, and installed-tree comparison. Replaying a saved receipt proves normalization from the parent workflow, not a new provider execution. An empty successful exit does not prove normalization or authorize dispatch.

### Claude primary-model evidence

For a change to Claude output parsing, install the candidate in both parents and invoke setup's availability phase. Use an external Claude descriptor in each parent so both exercise the parser. An exact Haiku ID without a native agent definition can exercise the external route from Claude Code. Preserve the installed tree identity, parent tool transcript, runner receipt, and independent output-file check.

Expect `stream-json` and `--verbose` in argv, `modelVerified: true`, and `modelEvidence: "provider-report"`. The reported model must come from main assistant events. A real probe establishes execution; a synthetic stream fixture establishes rejection behavior. Keep those claims separate.

From each installed parent, run the [synthetic boundary checks](../../../../../tests/claude-primary-model/verify-fixtures.py) with `--runner` pointing at that parent's installed runner, `--parent` matching the parent, and a fresh `--evidence` directory. The fixture covers valid primary plus helper usage, requested model used only by a helper, usage-only output, and conflicting primary models. Rejected cases must leave no output file and preserve the terminal-success veto against replay. Failure receipts must omit the private transcript marker.

### Codex completion evidence

For a change to Codex transcript assessment, install the exact candidate in both parents. From an installed Claude Code parent, dispatch an external `codex:*` lane through the shipped runner with a read-only marker task; retain the parent invocation, runner receipt, and an independent output-file check. From an installed Codex parent, verify skill discovery and dispatch a marker task through the native route for an approved `codex:*` descriptor — Codex-to-Codex dispatches through `spawn_agent` and never executes the external adapter, so do not bypass that rule or induce an external Codex call.

From each installed candidate, run the Codex runner regressions against the installed tree (`runner/codex.test.ts` and the `codex output acceptance and terminal veto` rows in `runner/run.test.ts`). The shared synthetic corpus proves acceptance versus the no-replay veto at the CLI boundary: item-only streams reject without completion evidence. A later unfinished turn rejects output while an earlier completed terminal still vetoes replay. Malformed lines preserve their precedence over typed quota failures. These fixtures prove parser behavior, not live provider execution; keep the claims separate and do not count them as the live adapter proof.

### Failure-receipt privacy

For a change to receipt diagnostics, run the `failure receipt privacy` rows of `runner/run.test.ts` plus the privacy rows of `runner/opencode.test.ts` and `runner/antigravity.test.ts` against the exact installed candidate (`bun test` inside the installed tree's `scripts/runner/`). The synthetic executable boundary emits canary markers for prompts, reasoning, tool input/output, narration, unknown envelope fields, malformed lines, and stderr noise across nonzero exits, malformed streams, provenance rejection, explicit deadlines, handled cancellation, and preflight failure, with cases covering all seven providers. Each row scans the whole serialized receipt, so the claim is about the artifact on disk, not a single field.

These fixtures prove the receipt boundary, not live provider execution. For the live claim, dispatch a failing external lane from each installed parent — a marker task ended by the explicit deadline or a forwarded signal is enough — retain the receipt, and confirm no prompt text, tool output, or stream content appears outside the declared terminal fields, canonical diagnostic codes, and structural counts. A retained terminal result or error message may still quote task content; that is the documented boundary limit, not a regression.

### Devin refusal-fallback isolation

Install the exact candidate in isolated Codex and Claude Code sessions. In each parent, invoke `pstack:setup-pstack` for the selected Devin availability probe only. Retain the frozen approved model sheet and use its model, effort, and API-spend policy. Do not save a new sheet.

Set `DEVIN_REFUSAL_FALLBACK` to a synthetic value in the test parent's environment. Put a transparent recorder before the real Devin executable on that session's `PATH`. The recorder must abort before invoking Devin if the variable reaches it. Otherwise, record only the variable's absence, the requested model argument, and the temporary permission configuration, then forward the original arguments and environment to the real executable. Do not record credentials or the full environment.

Have the parent launch the installed runner without unsetting the synthetic variable. Ask the read-only worker to return a unique marker from a file, then independently compare the output with that file. Retain the parent skill invocation, installed-tree identity, boundary records, receipt, and output. Expect the control to be absent from preflight and workload, the assigned model to remain pinned, and the permission configuration to retain its deny rules. Devin receipts must still report `modelEvidence: "pinned-argv"`, `modelVerified: false`, and the saved API-spend policy.

Run the Devin Bun regressions for absent, blank, and nonblank controls, unchanged parent input, and descendant inheritance at the synthetic executable boundary. Capture `devin --version` and `devin acp --help` to confirm the current CLI's fallback contract. These synthetic tests prove environment propagation. The real marker probe proves ordinary execution from each installed parent. Neither requires inducing a refusal or executing a backup model.

### OpenCode V1/V2 contracts and explicit funding

Install the exact candidate in dedicated Codex and Claude Code sessions using [installation](installation.md). Record the loaded version and compare the installed plugin tree with the candidate. The adapter selects its native contract once from the `opencode --version` banner: restored V1 (`>=1.18.29 <2`) or stable V2 (`>=2.0.0 <3`); tested versions are evidence, not an allowlist. Exercise the reviewed CLI versions from the provider-dispatch reference across both contracts — currently 1.18.32 on V1 and 2.0.0, 2.0.25, 2.0.26, and 2.0.27 on V2 — and capture `opencode --version` plus `opencode run --help` for each without inference. V2 2.0.0 is a missing-capability negative for subscription mode because native auth metadata omits credential methods. Verify rejection before invocation with an actionable diagnostic. Use 2.0.25 and 2.0.27 for successful V2 parent probes.

For subscription validation, use exactly `openai/gpt-6.1-sol@default`, `--api-spend deny`, and `--opencode-chatgpt-subscription` with the existing normal OpenCode ChatGPT login on each contract. Capture bounded passed native configuration/OAuth evidence; on V2 that includes the configured endpoint, while V1 uses the native builtin endpoint so the receipt records no configured endpoint. Do not inspect credential files, record auth-list account metadata, or claim the endpoint is attested. Rejected disposable non-secret key, mixed-auth, extra-entry, and Console fixtures must stop before workload invocation. Preserve the user's login and assignments.

From each installed parent, invoke `pstack:poteto-mode` and ask it to run the installed launcher for the explicit OpenCode subscription descriptor above in read-only mode. Provide a fresh fixture directory containing a unique marker file. The task must read the file and return its contents. Keep the actual parent invocation, installed launcher path, runner receipt, output, and independent comparison with the marker. Verify that the receipt records the chosen funding route, denied API spending, passed native configuration and applicable OAuth evidence, and pinned-argv model evidence. On V2, retain private JSONL and plain session export for validation, then independently confirm matching final assistant `stop`, completed time, session `succeeded`, trailing succeeded idle, and exactly one delivered marker. On V1 there is no session export; confirm the strict terminal stream instead — matching session and assistant identities, a tool-free final `step_finish` with reason `stop`, nonempty final text, and exactly one delivered marker. Runtime receipts must not contain the full export. The CLI stream does not independently attest the selected model, so `modelVerified` must remain false.

Repeat in writer mode in a fresh, parent-created disposable Git worktree. Ask the worker to read one fixture file and create a second file with its contents. Inspect the resulting file and Git diff independently. The parent owns Git operations; the worker must not run Git commands. Restore or remove only fixtures and worktrees created for this run.

Run `bun test runner/opencode.test.ts` against each installed candidate. The synthetic executable boundary must cover contract selection across stable V1 and V2 patch/minor versions, unsupported-version rejection before configuration or inference, V1 and V2 argv and configuration, denial of unexpected configuration sources and cross-contract output, hostile inherited OpenCode settings, V1 missing-finish rejection without export, V2 missing-finish and text-only reconciliation, stale/truncated/conflicting export rejection, usage counted once, native completion after nonzero workload or malformed handoff without output, export deadline/cancellation, V1 and V2 OAuth route rejection, frozen environment equality, error privacy, and cleanup after every subprocess settles. These fixtures prove adapter boundaries. They do not prove model execution or substitute for the live parent tasks.

An upstream 403, authentication failure, or unavailable model is a failed live test. Retain the receipt and sanitized failure details, leave the affected PR draft, and report the parent and provider paths as unverified. Do not retry with paid credentials, spoof client headers, or weaken the configuration check. A later successful test needs a fresh fixture and evidence directory.

## Gotchas

- Resolve is read-only and launches no providers; it cannot prove authentication, spending controls, or successful execution.
- Use the [provider dispatch route rules](../../../../../plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/provider-dispatch.md#native-lanes); same-provider identity alone does not establish a native Claude lane.
- A missing fallback-policy line means quota-only recovery. Generic failure is not quota exhaustion.
- Each real external attempt needs fresh output and receipt paths. Retain failed receipts and partial work; no implicit timeout or substitution is allowed.
